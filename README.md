Note: The whole dataset is about 300MB to 400MB.

###About the data format

All the data is stored in MatLab ".mat" file format. Each ".mat" file contains at least two variables: X and Y. "X" is a cell array of feature matrix (dimension N by d) and "Y" is the label vector (dimension N by 1), where N is the number of data points and d is the dimension of features. The specification of the data is listed below

Note: Caltech-7 and Caltech-20 are two subsets of Caltech-101, which contains only 7 and 20 classes respectively. The creation of these subsets is due to the unbalance of the number of data in each classes of Caltech-101.
